# game_life_in_cuhk_sz

Introduction
===
  The school life game is the main project in course CSC3002. Our game is based on QT window application.

  CUHK(SZ) is a young university with scenic campus. One day, while taking a walk on campus, 
our team came up with the idea that our campus could be a fantastic map in a role-playing game (RPG). 
Therefore, this project is going to design an RPG game, using CUHK(SZ) as the background. 

Requirements
===
QT version >= 5.

Game description
===
  The main character is set to be a CUHK(SZ) student, and experiences similar daily activities as a university student does, 
such as attending classes, participating in student clubs’ activities, helping professors with research projects, 
self-study in the library, hanging out for fun, dating with the girlfriend/boyfriend, and so on and so force. 
The character is attached with some attributes, including energy, moeny, IQ, EQ and glamor. 
Through different activities, the degree of these attributes could be improved or reduced. 
20 days in the game are equivalent to one semester.After two semesters, the main character will graduate. Besides the daily routine, 
the character might also randomly meet non-player characters (NPCs) or encounter some random events during the time. 
The final goal is to pass all exams and graduate successfully with high GPA. 

  When playing, the player needs to control the character to move among different venues to do different activities. 
On each day, the player is free to choose any activity he/she will like to do, but energy, time and money are limited. 
It is up to the player to make decisions. Moreover, there exist some activities that can only be triggered after 
the main character’s attributes meet predefined requirements.
